  details: "This cluster provides an interface for sending targeted commands to an Observer of a Content App on a Video Player device such as a Streaming Media Player, Smart TV or Smart Screen.\nThe cluster server for Content App Observer is implemented by an endpoint that communicates with a Content App, such as a Casting Video Client.\nThe cluster client for Content App Observer is implemented by a Content App endpoint.\nA Content App is informed of the NodeId of an Observer when a binding is set on the Content App. For a Content App Platform, the binding is set by the platform when a CastingVideoClient is granted access to the Content App, and the CastingVideoClient supports the Content App Observer cluster. The Content App can then send the ContentAppMessage to the Observer (server cluster), and the Observer responds with a ContentAppMessageResponse.\nThe Data and EncodingHint fields of the ContentAppMessage and ContentAppMessageResponse contain content app-specific values, the format and interpretation of which is defined by the Content App vendor, analogous to the custom message features offered by other popular casting protocols. Standardized cluster and commands are used here rather than manufacturer-specific cluster and commands because of the role that the Content App Platform plays in creating the ACLs and Bindings on both sides of the communication between the Content App Observer endpoint and the Content App endpoint.\nBy using standard cluster and commands:\n  1. The Content App Platform is able to easily determine that a binding is needed on the Content      App endpoint because it can recognize the Content App Observer cluster implemented by a client      node.\n  2. The Content App Platform is able to easily identify commands that are allowed to be sent by the      Content App to a client node because those commands use the Content App Observer cluster.\n  3. The Content App is able to easily determine that a node supports the Content App Observer      cluster because it has received a binding which specifies the Content App Observer cluster.\n  4. The Casting Video Client is able to support a single cluster for receiving commands from any      Content App and does not need to explicitly list every Content App it understands.\nA Content App Observer SHOULD ignore the Data and EncodingHint field values in commands from a Content App it does not recognize. A Content App SHOULD ignore the Data field values in responses when the EncodingHint value is blank or not recognized.",
