            details: "This feature is for a device that is managed by a service associated with the device vendor and which imposes default access restrictions upon each new fabric added to it. This could arise, for example, if the device is managed by a service provider under contract to an end-user, in such a way that the manager of the device does not unconditionally grant universal access to all of a device\u2019s functionality, even for fabric administrators. For example, many Home Routers are managed by an Internet Service Provider (a service), and these services often have a policy that requires them to obtain user consent before certain administrative functions can be delegated to a third party (e.g., a fabric Administrator). These restrictions are expressed using an Access Restriction List (ARL).\nThe purpose of this feature on the Access Control cluster is to indicate to a fabric Administrator that access by it to specific attributes, commands and/or events for specific clusters is currently prohibited. Attempts to access these restricted data model elements shall result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED.\nA device that implements this feature shall have a mechanism to honor the ReviewFabricRestrictions command, such as user interfaces or service interactions associated with a service provider or the device manufacturer, which allows the owner (or subscriber) to manage access restrictions for each fabric. The user interface design, which includes the way restrictions are organized and presented to the user, is not specified, but SHOULD be usable by non-expert end-users from common mobile devices, personal computers, or an on-device user interface.\nControllers and clients SHOULD incorporate generic handling of the ACCESS_RESTRICTED error code, when it appears in allowed contexts, in order to gracefully handle situations where this feature is encountered. Device vendors that adopt this feature SHOULD be judicious in its use given the risk of unexpected behavior in controllers and clients.\nFor certification testing, a device that implements this feature shall provide a way for all restrictions to be removed.\nThe ARL attribute provides the set of restrictions currently applied to this fabric.\nThe ReviewFabricRestrictions command provides a way for the fabric Administrator to request that the server triggers a review of the current fabric restrictions, by involving external entities such as end-users, or other services associated with the manager of the device hosting the server. This review process may involve communication between external services and the user, and may take an unpredictable amount of time to complete since an end-user may need to visit some resources, such as a mobile application or web site. A FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event will be generated by the device within a predictable time period of the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse (see ReviewFabricRestrictions for specification of this time period), and this event can be correlated with the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse using a token provided in both. The device may provide instructions or a Redirect URL in the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event in order to help the user access the features required for managing per-fabric restrictions.\nSee Section 6.6.2, \u201CModel\u201D for a description of how access control is impacted by the ARL attribute.\n### Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions\nUse of this feature shall be limited to the mandatory clusters of endpoints having a device type that explicitly permits its use in the Device Library Specification. As a reminder, the device types associated with an endpoint are listed in the Descriptor cluster of the endpoint.\nIn addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the following clusters on any endpoint:\n  1. the Descriptor Cluster (0x001D)\n  2. the Binding Cluster (0x001E)\n  3. the Network Commissioning Cluster (0x0031)\n  4. the Identify Cluster (0x0003)\n  5. the Groups Cluster (0x0004)\nIn addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the global attributes of any cluster.\nBecause ARLs cannot be used to restrict root node access or access to any clusters required for commissioning, administrators may determine the current restrictions of the ARL at any point, including during commissioning after joining the fabric."

The device     manufacturer may choose to use a constructed URL which is valid in a HTTP GET request (i.e.     dedicated for the product) such as, for example, https://domain.example/arl-app?vid=FFF1&     pid=1234. If a client follows or launches the ARLRequestFlowUrl, it shall expand it as described     in Section 9.10.9.3.4, \u201CARLRequestFlowUrl format\u201D.\n  \u2022 A manufacturer contemplating using this flow should realize that\n    \u25E6 This flow typically requires internet access to access the URL, and access extension may fail       when internet connectivity is not available.\n    \u25E6 If the flow prefers to redirect the user to an app which is available on popular platforms, it       SHOULD also provide a fallback option such as a web browser interface to ensure users can       complete access extension.\n### ARLRequestFlowUrl format\nThe ARLRequestFlowUrl shall contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4) composed of one or more key-value pairs:\n  \u2022 The query shall use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.\n  \u2022 The key-value pairs shall in the format name=<value> where name is the key name, and <value> is     the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.\n  \u2022 If key MTcu is present, it shall have a value of "_" (i.e. MTcu=_). This is the "callback URL     (CallbackUrl) placeholder".\n  \u2022 Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for     future use by this specification. Manufacturers shall NOT include query keys starting with MT in     the ARLRequestFlowUrl unless they are referenced by a version of this specification.\nAny other element in the ARLRequestFlowUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the fragment field (if present), shall remain including the order of query key/value pairs present.\nOnce the URL is obtained, it shall be expanded to form a final URL (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) by proceeding with the following substitution algorithm on the original ARLRequestFlowUrl:\n  1. If key MTcu is present, compute the CallbackUrl desired (see Section 9.10.9.3.5, \u201CCallbackUrl      format for ARL Request Flow response\u201D), and substitute the placeholder value "_" (i.e. in      MTcu=_) in the ARLRequestFlowUrl with the desired contents, encoded with proper URL-encoded      escaping (see RFC 3986 section 2).\nThe final URL after expansion (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) shall be the one to follow, rather than the original value obtained from the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event.\n### CallbackUrl format for ARL Request Flow response\nIf a CallbackUrl field (i.e. MTcu=) query field placeholder is present in the ARLRequestFlowUrl, the client may replace the placeholder value "_" in the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl with a URL that the manufacturer flow can use to make a smooth return to the client when the ARL flow has terminated.\nThis URL field may contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4). If a query is present, it shall be composed of one or more key-value pairs:\n  \u2022 The query shall use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.\n  \u2022 The key-value pairs shall follow the format name=<value> where name is the key name, and <value>     is the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.\n  \u2022 If key MTaer is present, it shall have a value of "_" (i.e. MTaer=_). This is the placeholder     for a "access extension response" provided by the manufacturer flow to the client. The     manufacturer flow shall replace this placeholder with the final status of the access extension     request, which shall be formatted following Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom     flow and encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.\n  \u2022 Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for     future use by this specification.\nAny other element in the CallbackUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the fragment field (if present), shall remain as provided by the client through embedding within the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl, including the order of query key/value pairs present.\nOnce the CallbackUrl is obtained by the manufacturer flow, it may be expanded to form a final ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl URL to be used by proceeding with the following substitution algorithm on the provided CallbackUrl:\n  \u2022 If key MTaer is present, the manufacturer custom flow having received the initial query     containing the CallbackUrl shall substitute the placeholder value "_" (i.e. in MTaer=_) in the     CallbackUrl with the final status of the access extension request flow which shall be one of the     following. Any value returned in the MTaer field not listed above shall be considered an error     and shall be treated as GeneralFailure.\n    \u25E6 Success - The flow completed successfully and the ARL attribute was updated. The client may       now read the ARL attribute to determine the new access restrictions.\n    \u25E6 NoChange - The ARL attribute was already listing minimum restrictions for the requesting       fabric.\n    \u25E6 GeneralFailure - The flow failed for an unspecified reason.\n    \u25E6 FlowAuthFailure - The user failed to authenticate to the flow.\n    \u25E6 NotFound - Access extension failed because the target fabric was not found.\nA manufacturer custom flow having received an ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl SHOULD attempt to open the ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl, on completion of the request, if an ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl was computed from the CallbackUrl and opening such a URL is supported.\n### Examples of ARLRequestFlowUrl URLs\nBelow are some examples of valid ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl for several valid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl, as well as some examples of invalid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl:\n  \u2022 Invalid URL with no query string: http scheme is not allowed:\n    \u25E6 http://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234\n  \u2022 Valid URL :\n    \u25E6 https://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234\n  \u2022 Valid URL, CallbackUrl requested:\n    \u25E6 Before expansion:\nhttps://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTcu=_\n  \u25E6 After expansion:     https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTcu=https%3A%2F%2Fc     lient.domain.example%2Fcb%3Ftoken%3DmAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%253D%253D%26MTaer%3D_\n  \u25E6 The ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL contains:\n    \u25AA A CallbackUrl with a client-provided arbitrary token= key/value pair and the MTaer= key/value       pair place-holder to indicate support for a return access extension completion status:       https://client.domain.example/cb?token=mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&MTaer=_\n    \u25AA After expansion of the CallbackUrl (MTcu key) into an ExpandedCallbackUrl, with an example       return access extension completion status of Success, the ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl would       be:\nhttps://client.domain.example/cb?token=mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&MTaer=Success\nNote that the MTcu key/value pair was initially provided URL-encoded within the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL and the MTaer=_ key/value pair placeholder now contains a substituted returned completion status.\n  \u2022 Invalid URL, due to MTza=79 key/value pair in reserved MT-prefixed keys reserved for future use:\n    \u25E6 https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTop=_&MTza=79'
