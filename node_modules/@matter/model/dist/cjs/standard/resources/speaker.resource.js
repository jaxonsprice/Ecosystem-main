A value of TRUE for the OnOff attribute shall represent the volume on (not muted) state, while a value of FALSE shall represent the volume off (muted) state. For volume level control, the Level cluster shall be used.\nA dedicated endpoint is needed because the On/Off cluster can also be used for other purposes, such as for power control.\nThe decision to use Level and On/Off clusters for volume (rather than defining a new audio control cluster) was made in order to treat volume in a fashion consistent with lighting which also uses these clusters and has matching functional requirements.",
