This cluster provides the list of supported keypad inputs and provides a command for sending them.\nThe cluster server for Keypad Input is implemented by a device that can receive keypad input, such as a Video Player, or an endpoint that can receive keypad input, such as a Content App.\nThe key codes used are those defined in the HDMI CEC specification (see HDMI).\nDevices may understand a subset of these key codes. Feature flags are used to indicate a specific subset that is supported. Device may support additional codes beyond what is indicated in feature flags.",

In other words, a specific content app endpoint shall NOT process a keycode received by a different content app endpoint.\nIf a second SendKey request with the same KeyCode value is received within 200 ms, then the endpoint will consider the first key press to be a press and hold.
