This cluster provides a sleep() command to allow clients to manually put the device into low power mode. There is no command here to wake up a sleeping device because that operation often involves other protocols such as Wake On LAN. Most devices automatically enter low power mode based upon inactivity.\nThe cluster server for Low Power is implemented by a device that supports a low power mode, such as a TV, Set-top box, or Smart Speaker.\n> [!NOTE]\n> We have considered a \u201CDisableLowPowerMode\u201D command but have not added it due to suspected issues   with energy consumption regulations. This can be added in the future.",
